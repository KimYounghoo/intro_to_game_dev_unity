Challenge you faced and overcome

Next steps

* there was no story of magic here

* You need energy in your presentation -- you had it in your card presentation. Practice presenting. 
* good explanation of how you used your cards 
* good use of scope and management 
* UX needs lots of help 
* font usage 
* I wish we had more time to talk about how to break a card game back into game play 
I might of made the UI not a car 
* you need to get the glue together 
* got a bit down in the weeds technically

### Feedback on game pitch concepts from Feb 01, 2015 

**Overarching comments for everyone in the room:** Work on a pitch not a word doc for in class presentations. See it as an illustration of an idea verses a long form game design document. 
Think about your art. There's a lack of focus on game art. More illustrative screen grabs would of benefited the whole group. 

*A word on absences:* If you missed this class you are  being docked 5 point on your for your final grade. Not turning up to an in class deadline is unacceptable unless assets are handed in ahead of time  or you have been granted prior permission. Should anyone who missed today have a doctor's note, please bring it in to avoid being penalized.
